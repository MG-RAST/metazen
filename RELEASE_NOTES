OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
Metazen provides an interactive webpage for users to generate an Excel spreasheet for their sequencing sample metadata.


VERSION: 1.1 (Released 04/24/2014)
------------------------------------------
Replaced Bioportal widgets displaying ontology trees with a javascript version taken from Retina at:
https://github.com/MG-RAST/Retina/blob/master/js/standalone.tree.js

This change allows us to display older versions of the ontology no longer being hosted by Bioportal.  Also,
only the most recent versions are being served by them so version is always changing.  Stable versions of
their ontologies are being stored at MG-RAST and are accessible through the MG-RAST API at:
http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/metadata/


VERSION: 1.0 (Released 10/01/2013)
------------------------------------------
UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
 - Authentication of users thru an oAuth server for prefilling project information from previous sequencing projects.
